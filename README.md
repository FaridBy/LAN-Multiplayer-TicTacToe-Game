# LAN-Multiplayer-TicTacToe-Game
This project covers multiplayer gaming applications for wireless ad-hoc networks. It was developed using the Python programming language. A room and server are required for players to come together and play. For this purpose, a room using TCP/IP protocols was created using the socket library. The game, which initially runs on localhost IP, has been made playable online via the local network (LAN) system. To create a wireless ad-hoc network, users must be directed. For this purpose, a Network Routing application called Hamachi was used and the communication port number 3000 was used. Thus, players have a room where they can come together and play games in a reliable network, regardless of distance.
